# Prophet-Model
## A project which uses the Prophet time series forecasting model to predict the Battery power consumption at Saarland University Germany. 

This project was built to predict the battery power consumption at saarland university. The key features are described below:
* Provides a way to visualise the data.
* A basic prophet model and the trends in the input data.
* Including the temperature readings from German weather observatory.
* Analysing the correlation between the weather and battery consumption.
* Including weather as an addition input to the Prophet model.
* Training the model on the data od previous days and make the model to prodict the battery consumption of the next day automatically.
* The model trains every day with new actual data on battery consumption.

The input data was the battery consumption in csv format which was changed to a proper time series data. While trying this for your own applications use a good input time data in a csv format.
